description: 🧩 Manually installing Extensions.
---

Extensions, in a nutshell, are JavaScript files that will be evaluated along with Spotify main JavaScript.

## Installing

Extension files can be store in:

- `Extensions` folder in Home directory:

| Platform            | Path                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\Extensions\`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions`       |

- `Extensions` folder in Spicetify executable directory.

If there are 2 extensions with the same name, the extension within the Home directory will be prioritized.

Some Spotify API endpoints are exposed and can be found in the global object `Spicetify`. Check out `global.d.ts` for API documentation.

After placing the extension file into correct folder, run following command to install it:

```bash
spicetify config extensions <file name>
spicetify apply
```

**Note:** Using `config` command to add extension always append file name to existed extensions list. It does not replace the whole key's value.

## Uninstalling

If you want to remove an extension from the current list of extensions you can always append a `-` after the file name:

```bash
spicetify config extensions <file name>-
spicetify apply
```

## Manual Install

You can always manually edit the config file, add your desired extension filenames in `extensions` key, separated them by `|` character.  
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
extensions = autoSkipExplicit.js|queueAll.js|djMode.js|shuffle+.js|trashbin.js
```

Afterwards, you will need to run the following:

```
spicetify apply
```
