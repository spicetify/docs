Extensions, in a nutshell, are JavaScript files that will be evaluated along with Spotify main JavaScript.

## Installing

Extension files can be stored in:

- `Extensions` folder in Home directory:

| Platform            | Path                                   |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Windows**         | `%appdata%\spicetify\Extensions\`      |
| **Linux**/**MacOS** | `~/.config/spicetify/Extensions`       |

- `Extensions` folder in Spicetify executable directory.

If there are 2 extensions with the same name, the extension within the Home directory will be prioritized.

Some Spotify API endpoints are exposed and can be found in the global object `Spicetify`. Check out `global.d.ts` for API documentation.

After placing the extension file into correct folder, run following command to install it:

```bash
spicetify config extensions <file name>
spicetify apply
```

**Note:** Using `config` command to add extension always append file name to existed extensions list. It does not replace the whole key's value.

## Uninstalling

If you want to remove an extension from the current list of extensions you can always append a `-` after the file name:

```bash
spicetify config extensions <file name>-
spicetify apply
```

## Manual Install

You can always manually edit the config file, add your desired extension filenames in `extensions` key, separated them by `|` character.  
Example:

```ini
[AdditionalOptions]
...
extensions = autoSkipExplicit.js|queueAll.js|djMode.js|shuffle+.js|trashbin.js
```

Afterwards, you will need to run the following:

```
spicetify apply
```

## Extensions

### Bookmark

**Filename:** `bookmark.js`

Easily store and browse pages, play tracks or tracks in specific time. Useful for who wants to check out an artist, album later without following them or writing their name down.
