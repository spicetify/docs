One of the most popular features in Spicetify is theming.
You can customize your Spotify to your <span style={{'color': '#1039'}}>**heart's**</span> desire!
**However**, this is a very cumbersome task.

For this reason, the theming heroes of the Spicetify community have created a huge library of themes which can be found in the following repositories:

1. [spicetify/spicetify-themes](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes) - The official Spicetify themes repository. Feel free to contribute with more themes!
