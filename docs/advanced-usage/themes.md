One of the most popular features in Spicetify is theming.
You can customize your Spotify to your <span style={{'color': '#CB1010'}}>**heart's**</span> desire!
**However**, this is a very cumbersome task.

For this reason, the theming heroes of the Spicetify community have created a huge library of themes which can be found in the following repositories:

1. [spicetify/spicetify-themes](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes)
2. [NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-spicetify)
3. Insert your theme here!
